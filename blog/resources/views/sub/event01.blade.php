                <h3>Welcome to our 2nd Silicon Valley Business Forum 2020!</h3>
                <p class="ft_rb">
                    The forum started from September 2020 virtually hosted by our partners from Silicon Valley and Seoul. However, the cooperation 
                    and engagement of both sides began much earlier, focusing on electric vehicles, clean energy, smart cities, sustainable agriculture 
                    nd safety under an umbrella of global sustainability.<br/><br/>
                     
                    Confronted with worsening COVID-19 around the world, we decided to have a day absolutely dedicated to address the healthcare 
                    issue. During the first day of the forum, we will have companies from Silicon Valley and other parts of North America and UK 
                    with cutting-edge technology and proven track record of solid business in the sector present their cases and share their knowledge 
                    and experiences. Korean panelists will present their cases as well and discuss the technologies presented during the forum, while 
                    taking questions from the audience.<br/><br/>
                    
                    On the third day, we will have companies and panelists to address clean energy, e-mobility and smart cities. Speakers will be the 
                    leaders and pioneers of their fields with practical experiences. We strongly believe that every participant will leave the forum excited 
                    and inspired. <br/><br/>
