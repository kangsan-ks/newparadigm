The startup develops software systems for autonomous mass transit fleets and is currently in meetings with cities and transit providers. Its founding team includes CEO Joel Pazhayampallil, previously co-founder of Drive.ai, which was acquired by Apple earlier this year, and president and COO Christine Moon, whose experience includes serving as head of partnerships for Google’s Nexus program.<br/><br/>
                                Bluespace.ai’s team also has people who have worked at AV companies like Zoox, Lyft Level 5 and Voyage. Their combined experience includes launching AV fleets in Texas, California and Florida. Bluespace.ai’s specific focus is on increasing the overall ability and efficiency across trunk transit routes with higher rider capacity. While other startups have primarily focused on first- and last-mile solutions for slow-speed vehicles that are part of main transit systems, Bluespace.ai’s aim is to safely enable full-size vehicles that can travel on public roads at road speed, therefore serving more passengers at a time.<br/><br/>
                                Ms. Christine Moon, COO: Christine Moon thrives on impacting millions of lives through technology and working with a passionate group of people to shape the future together. BlueSpace.ai is powering the future of urban mobility with its AV (autonomous vehicle) software technology. Taking a faster and safer approach to driverless to enable commercialization.
